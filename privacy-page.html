<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This page explains how we handle information collected through our social media profiles and any linked tools or forms.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not directly collect personal information from visitors unless they voluntarily provide it (for example by sending us a direct message or filling a form we link to). Public analytics tools (e.g. Meta Insights, Google Analytics) may collect aggregated and anonymized data such as views, impressions and audience demographics.</p>

<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p>Any voluntarily shared information may be used to reply to messages, improve content, or understand audience interests. Aggregated analytics are used to evaluate content performance.</p>

<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell or rent personal information. Information may be processed by third-party platforms used for publishing or analytics (e.g. Meta, Google, scheduling tools) under their respective privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Cookies & Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Linked sites and analytics tools may use cookies or similar technologies. These are controlled by those third parties and governed by their policies.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain message history or submitted information only as long as necessary to serve the original purpose or as required by the platformâ€™s default retention policy.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may request access, correction or deletion of information you voluntarily shared with us by contacting us via direct message or the channel through which you provided it.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of our pages implies acceptance of the current version.</p>
